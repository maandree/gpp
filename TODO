This should only used when necessary when
when a specific flag is used.
  Before all lines, add 10ⁿ−1 empty lines
  where n is as small as possible to retain
  as line numbers but with a constant
  multiple.
  Then add m10ᷜ number of empty lines
  at the top of the file, where k is large
  and n is the number specified above.
  Because of line continuations and disc
  resources it is best to implement this
  in gpp.

The option above should be aware of
line continues using a backslash at
the end of the line before the
continuation unless another flag is
used. This could either be an additional
flag or an alternative flag (uppercase
of the above's.)
